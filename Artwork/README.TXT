
README.TXT for ARTWORK directory

The artwork within this directory is for you to use in your game
programs. It was created by myself and the other artists here at
Xtreme Games LLC. You may use the art for your own games. However, there
are two rules you must follow if you sell or distribute your game:

* Rule 1: You must put a special thanks to Xtreme Games LLC\me for supplying 
          the artwork.

* Rule 2: You can't sell the art to someone for a profit or as part of
          a clipart package.


That's it!


Sincerely,



Andre' LaMothe
