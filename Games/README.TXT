
READ ME for GAMES directory.

Within this directory are a number of cool games all writen by small teams one or more.

Each game has it's own method of installation. Some are self extracting,
some have install programs, a number of them must first be de-compressed with
WinZip (also on the CD in APPLICATIONS\) or similar software and then loaded on your 
hard drive. Then many of the games need to be setup to configure the sound
and other various options, so after loading each game on your drive, take
a look for a SETUP.EXE or INSTALL.EXE program.

Whatever the case is I'm sure you'll figure it out :)
