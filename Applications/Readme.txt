
README.TXT for APPLICATIONS directory

Within this directory is a gold mine of application programs. They are
of course shareware and demos, but you can at least try them out. I have
included the following applications:

TRUESPACE      <DIR> - TrueSpace:  A 3D modeler.

SForge         <DIR> - Sound Forge: A sound editing program.

MSWORDVIEW     <DIR> - Microsoft WORD viewer.

PAINTSHOPPRO   <DIR> - Paint Shop Pro: A paint program.

WINZIP         <DIR> - WinZip: A compression/decompression program.

ACROBAT        <DIR> - Acrobat Reader: Adobe Acrobat reader to read
                       .PDF files. You'll need this to read the bonus articles
                       and chapters that are in .PDF format.


To load and install any of the programs simply change directories and
read the README files for specific information. In most cases, you just
need to launch a self extracting .EXE file and that will load each application
respectively.
