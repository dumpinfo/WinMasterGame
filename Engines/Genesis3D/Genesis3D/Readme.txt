
To the reader,

All good things must come to an end.  I have been working on the volumes
in this project since January 1999.  They have grown, changing as the software 
they documented evolved.  When Eclipse decided to make this an Open Source Project 
the amount to document increased drastically.  So much that it became obvious I would 
not be able to finish all the new function calls they had revealed before Release 2.0 
became available.  So I made a difficult decision.  When it became obvious that Version 2 
was immanent I would move on as well, filling in the old function calls as time permitted, 
for those who chose to use Version 1 as their development platform.

That decision was further complicated by Andre' LaMothe's generous offer to include as much 
of this material as I wanted, along with a copy of Version 1.0 in his latest book.  But, 
he also faces deadlines and the time for delivery to him has also arrived. And so these 
works are being passed on to you as they are.  They are part of a wonderful experience for me.  
I am moving on to Release 2.0 of the Genesis3D Engine - a project that excites me at least as 
much as this one did - which says a lot since I've been typing for six months now. The most recent 
version of these documents can be found by going to the Genesis3D Webring, which I created and 
continue to manage. The website address is a long one and looks a bit strange...

http://www.webring.org/cgi-bin/webring?ring=genesisring;home

I hope that this works will be useful to you and that you will drop by the Webring to check 
out what the Genesis3D community is up to. Finally, I would like to thank David Stafford and 
all the people who worked at Eclipse software during this project for creating a wonderful 
product that so many people will benefit from. 

Special thanks to Andre' LaMothe for generously offering to put these volumes into his latest 
book and thus give another person a chance to contribute to this industry. 

A last thought...

Interactive Game Design is among the hardest disciplines currently available to mankind.
No other occupation requires such a diversity of skills, such creativity, or such discipline 
to complete. To inform and entertain others is a respectable goal.  Ours is an infant art.  
Always strive to do your best, for someday you will be judged among the giants.
